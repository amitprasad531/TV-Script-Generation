# TV-Script-Generation

These files are my solutions for the third project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course. The objective was to model recurrent neural networks that will learn from a selection of 'The Simpsons' scripts in order to generate new TV scripts.

Python and Tensorflow were used to program and model the network. The code is included in dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb.
